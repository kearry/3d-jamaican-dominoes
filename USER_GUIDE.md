## Game Overview

Jamaican Dominoes is a popular variation of the classic dominoes game, typically played with four players. The objective is to be the first player to play all your dominoes, or to have the lowest total points when the game is blocked (no more possible moves).

## Getting Started

1. **Launch the Game**: Open your web browser and navigate to the game URL
2. **Start New Game**: Click on the "New Game" button on the home page
3. **Game Setup**: The game will automatically deal dominoes to you and three AI opponents
4. **Begin Play**: The player with the double-six starts the game

## Game Interface

- **Player Areas**: Your dominoes are displayed at the bottom of the screen
- **Opponent Areas**: AI players' dominoes (face down) are displayed on the other sides
- **Game Status**: Current player, game phase, and other information are displayed at the bottom

### Controls

- **Debug Button**: Provides access to game state information (for development)

## How to Play

### Starting the Game

1. The game automatically identifies the player with the double-six (6-6) domino
2. This player must play the double-six as the first move
3. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table

### Taking Your Turn

When it's your turn:

1. Select a domino from your hand that has a number matching one of the end numbers on the board
2. Place the domino on the appropriate end of the chain
3. If you cannot make a valid move, click "Pass"

### Game End

The game ends when:

- One player plays all their dominoes (winner)
- The game is blocked (no player can make a valid move)
  - In this case, the player with the lowest total pip count wins

## Game Rules

### Basic Rules

1. **Standard Domino Set**: The game uses a standard set of 28 dominoes (double-six set)
2. **Four Players**: The game is played with four players
3. **Starting**: The player with the double-six starts
4. **Matching Numbers**: Dominoes must be placed so that one end matches a number at the end of the chain
5. **Doubles**: Double dominoes (e.g., 6-6, 5-5) are placed perpendicular to the chain
6. **Passing**: If you cannot make a valid move, you must pass
7. **Winning**: The first player to play all their dominoes wins

### Jamaican Variations

- Double dominoes are placed perpendicular to create a branch in the chain
- The next domino after a double can be played on any of the three open ends

## Tips and Strategies

### For Beginners

1. **Play high-value dominoes early**: Try to play your highest value dominoes early in the game
2. **Keep track of played dominoes**: Pay attention to which numbers have been played
3. **Block opponents**: If possible, play dominoes that make it difficult for the next player

### Advanced Strategies

1. **Count the dominoes**: Keep track of how many of each number has been played
2. **Create forced passes**: Try to make both ends of the chain show the same number that you know opponents don't have
3. **Save doubles**: Sometimes it's strategic to hold onto doubles for later in the game

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Game Won't Start**: Try refreshing the page
- **Cannot Place Domino**: Ensure you're selecting a valid placement location
- **Visual Glitches**: If 3D elements don't render correctly, check that your browser supports WebGL

### System Requirements

- **Browser**: Modern browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Internet**: Stable internet connection
- **Input**: Mouse/trackpad for selecting and placing dominoes
