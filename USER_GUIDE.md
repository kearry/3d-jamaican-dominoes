## Game Rules

### Basic Rules of Jamaican Dominoes

1. **Setup**:
   - Each player receives 7 dominoes
   - The player with the double-six starts the game
   - If no player has the double-six, the player with the highest double plays first

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns clockwise
   - Players must match one end of their domino to an open end of the domino chain
   - If a player cannot play, they must pass their turn
   - Double dominoes are placed perpendicular to the chain

3. **Scoring**:
   - The first player to play all their dominoes wins the round
   - The winner scores points equal to the sum of all pips on opponents' remaining dominoes
   - Games are typically played to 100 or 200 points

### Special Rules in this Implementation

1. **Team Play**:
   - Players sitting opposite each other form a team
   - Teams share their score
   - Strategy involves helping your partner

2. **Blocking**:
   - If all players pass consecutively and the boneyard is empty, the round ends
   - The player or team with the lowest sum of pips in their hand wins

## Playing the Game

### Making a Move

1. When it's your turn, select a domino from your hand by clicking on it
2. The game will highlight valid positions on the table where you can play
3. Click on a valid position to place your domino
4. If you're playing a double, the game will automatically place it perpendicular

### Understanding the Chain

The domino chain has two ends where new dominoes can be played:

1. **Matching Numbers**: Your domino must have a matching number on at least one of its halves
2. **Double Branching**: When a double is played, it creates a branch point with three possible places to play

### Using Game Assists

The game provides several assists to help you play:

1. **Highlighting**: Valid moves are highlighted when you select a domino
2. **Auto-Pass**: The game will notify you if you have no valid moves
3. **Undo**: You can undo your last move in single-player mode

## Advanced Strategies

### Counting Dominoes

- Keep track of which dominoes have been played
- Count how many of each number (0-6) has been played
- This helps predict what opponents might have

### Blocking Opponents

- If you notice an opponent is running low on dominoes, try to block their likely moves
- Play dominoes that make it difficult for the next player to play

### Team Strategies

When playing in teams:

1. **Open for Partner**: Try to create opportunities for your partner to play
2. **Block Opponents**: Focus on blocking the opposing team
3. **Communication**: While direct communication about dominoes is not allowed, watch your partner's plays for clues
